Appium Project
Apium is used to automate mobile applications. It is based on selenium web driver using multiple languages

Installation
download appium using online resources including its server and inspector

Run
if you are using the command line to run appium then the command is below:

IDE
I have used IntelliJ as an IDE and android studio for the SDK manager and emulator

Usage
1st, you have to start the server in the Appium server. As soon as it gets started, navigate to the Appium inspector and give the desired capabilities. Like device name, platform name, app Package, etc. once it is done, run the session and your app will be run in the emulator. then do some tasks which you are being assigned and record them. copy the code and paste that code in IntelliJ. for IntelliJ. There are a bunch of dependencies that will most likely be installed on their own. if not, then download them "https://mvnrepository.com/" Everything will work smoothly.
